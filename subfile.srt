1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,420
Now I'm going to demonstrate how to cut out only a small part of an image.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,730
As always the important part is choosing the right image.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,310
You can do this with any photo you can stick out ends of the object like table corners hands legs hands

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,210
branches and so on any object that has a prominent tip

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,500
first step in this process to define the container of the image the frame in which it sets because you're

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,670
sticking something out of that frame.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,860
If you're going to use the photo as a full background photo then edges off your frame are actually not

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,670
visible.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,310
You can't stick anything out.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm going to work on this image in this tutorial I have linked the same image so you can follow along.

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,970
We can easily stake out that year of the dog.

12
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,760
That means our frame has to have a top border.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,710
If you stretches from top to bottom of the screen then this image won't work at all.

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,690
But if I use a frame like a circle for example then I can stick that year out without a problem.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,550
So let's frame the photo first

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,920
just like we're doing figure we're going to create a mask.

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,100
We're going to use the same masking tool as we did previously in the cut out method but this time instead

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,570
of selecting the dog from the background we're going to select a circle.

19
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,300
Part of that dog in the marquee tool right click on it and select the elliptical market.

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,410
All this is in other words select or I don't even know what market means now by dragging select the

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:31,080
face of the dog hold shift while you do this so you can draw a perfect circle to get a better handle

22
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,320
you can press on spacebar to move this election around.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,180
You don't need to get this perfectly right now.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,740
We can always resize and reposition the image of the dog later as we did last time.

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,820
Click Select and mask up here.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,970
You're already familiar with this mask Ed but we're not going to add a here or anything actually because

27
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,680
we need a perfect circle mask.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,930
So right away go to output options and select new layer with layer mask like we did last time.

29
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,240
Third now we have the same arrangement as in the cut out method

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,500
if you need to reposition or re scale the image inside we can do that similarly like we do in figure

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,630
select the move tool first.

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,140
By default Mass Group is locked so you can move the image separately it's moving an entire group to

33
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,830
move just the image or just the mass click on this link icon here.

34
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,130
It will unlike the image from the mask and now you can move them separately by selecting either the

35
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,560
image or the mask from the latest list

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,900
you'll notice that mask and Photoshop is a defined space as it was defined originally.

37
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,660
That's why we have this extra bits showing here.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,400
If you end up with this extra bits after moving your image around you can just crop this out with a

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:56,750
crop top.

40
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,740
By the way Photoshop has this very handy tool called History panel.

41
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,930
Instead of undoing on an eye you can go directly to the stamp that you want to undo.

42
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,300
I love this historic tool and Photoshop makes undoing much easier.

43
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,220
OK so repositioning image inside is easy.

44
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,320
Just drag the image around but to re scale the image select the image layer and then go to edit and

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,600
free transform.

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,690
Now you can grab the handles and resize it as you wish.

47
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,110
Hold Shift to lock the ratio here in my hand.

48
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,530
I'm imagining what parts I'm going to stick out so I can position the image properly

49
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,480
now that we have prepared our main frame in which our image sets.

50
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,580
We can now stick that year out of it to do this.

51
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,090
We're going to basically cut out a piece of the dogs here as a separate layer and place it on top of

52
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,490
this existing layer.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,490
So right click on this mass group and duplicate the layer

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,800
now right click on the mask itself not the entire layer but just the mask and click delete layer mask

55
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,410
now we have the full image on top of it.

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,820
If we cut out a chunk of the year from this full image and remove the rest we will get the exact stick

57
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,060
out.

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,140
In fact we want to do so we do the usual cut out method just like we did in the previous lesson.

59
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,760
Grab a quick selection tool

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,670
set the right brush from the options from here.

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,350
Make sure you have selected the brush with the plus sign not the minus set the hardness to 100 percent

62
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,110
and set the right size so you can select that year easily

63
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,140
turn they'll pass it down to see the edge of the frame and select accordingly

64
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,460
you can select more of the image on the bottom because it's not going to do us harm.

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,240
It's just going to be sitting on top of the existing photo anyways that looks good.

66
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Now click select and mask.

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,810
We are seeing both of the layers here.

68
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
Our frame layer and just that your layer.

69
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,440
Let's change the background to white for now so we can refine the edge of that year

70
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,210
remember how to refine that just select the refined H2 and go over the edges.

71
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,960
So it adds in any missing hair or any other missing pixels as I mentioned before with this tool we are

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,450
telling Photoshop to look beyond our selection and detect any missing pixels.

73
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:12,950
You don't have to refine the base of the year it will merge perfectly with the background image.

74
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,740
Now go to output settings and select new layer with layer mask and hit.

75
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,410
OK there.

76
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:28,150
That's our ear sticking out let's put a white background on this so we can see the results better.

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,260
Create new layer

78
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,920
and click the new feel I can hear.

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,050
Select solid color and choose white

80
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,940
now drag that layer below everything

81
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,800
if you're going to use a different color in your actual designs.

82
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,730
You can double click on the feel and change the color so you can visualize this right here in Photoshop

83
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,010
before you export the final result.

84
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,960
For example when I put this on a dark color we can notice that there is some extra layer behind the

85
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,710
ear.

86
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,410
Too bad I didn't check this one refining the selection but we can still do some work on this.

87
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,320
Even after the mask has been applied the mask is still editable.

88
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:36,470
If we zoom in on the mask layer you'll see we have black and white parts the white parts are visible

89
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,200
part of the mask and black parts are hidden part.

90
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,140
That's why the white part has a shape of the ear.

91
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,070
If we paint white on this mask we will show more of the image.

92
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,790
Let me demonstrate

93
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,970
if I select a regular rational and draw on it with white paint.

94
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,760
It's going to show more of the image

95
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,550
and if I draw with a black paint on it it will hide whatever is already visible

96
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,090
to switch between white and black brush.

97
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,640
Click on this arrow icon on top of this black and white boxes.

98
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,140
Whatever is on top is the current color of the brush.

99
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,320
There is also a shortcut.

100
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,860
You can hit X on your keyboard and then it will switch between the two.

101
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,470
Okay now we can remove the extra glare from behind the ear.

102
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm going to adjust the brush to make it smooth and feathery so I don't create any hard edges.

103
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:48,110
In this case I'm going to decrease the hardness completely and even decrease the passage to 50 percent.

104
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,360
This way I will brush over the parts and in a smooth and controlled manner.

105
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,480
And that's a better result.

106
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,750
It might not be ideal on a black background but works quite well.

107
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,240
Best to refine this during the masking face.

108
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,710
And don't forget to check the view on the black background.

109
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,440
If you plan on using it on dark backgrounds

110
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,860
the last step is to export the image we're going to export in PSG with a transparent background.

111
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,640
That way you have more freedom to choose background directly.

112
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,690
In fact my during actual design process height the background crop out any extra space.

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,320
And under File Export.

114
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,080
Click quick export as PNC

115
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,340
and there you have it.

116
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,920
This can be now important inside FEMA and use on different backgrounds.
