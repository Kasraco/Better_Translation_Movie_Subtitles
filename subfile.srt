00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,420
Now I'm going to demonstrate how to cut out only a small part of an image.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,730
As always the important part is choosing the right image.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,310
You can do this with any photo you can stick out ends of the object like table corners hands legs hands

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,210
branches and so on any object that has a prominent tip

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,500
first step in this process to define the container of the image the frame in which it sets because you're

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,670
sticking something out of that frame.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,860
If you're going to use the photo as a full background photo then edges off your frame are actually not

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,670
visible.
